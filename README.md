# Calculations for "Alternating Donor-Acceptor Thienoacenes Featuring Up to 23 Linearly Fused Rings"

This repository contains computational material in the interactive Jupyter notebooks and data files supported by the [MLatom](https://github.com/dralgroup/mlatom) program used for generating and analyzing the calculations in the study:
 
Jian-Cheng Song, Xin-Yu Tong, Bai-Yang Qian, Jianbin Lin, Pavlo O. Dral, Hui-Jun Zhang. Alternating Donor-Acceptor Thienoacenes Featuring Up to 23 Linearly Fused Rings. *To be submitted*.

## Content description

* ``ita.ipynb`` - Jupyter notebook.
* ``ita.html`` - its version in html format so that it can be browsed with any web browser ([CLICK HERE TO BROWSE](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://gitfront.io/r/dral/cTeTc2aMnE8U/ita/raw/ita.html)).
* ``calculations`` folder containing the parsed calculation data in MLatom format (also saving space). The full data can be accessed on [figshare](https://figshare.com/s/1c9cb093407f48230c2f).

## Prerequisites

If you want to run Jupyter notebook, you will need MLatom 3.16.2 or higher (the notebook was tested with MLatom 3.16.2).

To perform UAIQM calculations the user would need to either use MLatom@XACS or request A-MLatom as [described elsewhere](http://mlatom.com/amlatom/).

## Contributors

- Calculations were performed by Xin-Yu Tong.
- Analysis of calculations by Xin-Yu Tong and Pavlo O. Dral.
